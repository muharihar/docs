### Backward-incompatible changes

- We are changing the way in which composite foreign key matches are evaluated. A composite foreign key is a key with more than one column in it.  Up until now, we've claimed that our composite keys were matched using the MATCH FULL method, which was almost correct.  For all matching methods, there are two categories.  Keys that are 3 types of keys:  * valid - keys that can be used for matching foreign key relationships * invalid - keys that will not be used for matching * unacceptable - keys that cannot be inserted at all  If a key is not valid for matching, it will not be affected by any foreign key checking and is allowed to violate the relationship.  MATCH FULL stipulates that valid keys can have no NULL values. And invalid keys must have all NULL values. Keys with any combination of both values and NULLs cannot are unacceptable.  Until now, we allowed explicit NULL values if there was a corresponding NULL value. This was incorrect.  Of course, this can easily be corrected, but not without possibly making some foreign key relationships invalid. To fix this, all matches going forward will now use the MATCH SIMPLE method.  MATCH SIMPLE stipulates that valid keys have no NULL.  Invalid keys are ones with one or more NULLs instead of the stricter no-NULLs allowed from MATCH FULL. So now the presence of a single NULL will mean that the key will not attempt to be matched in foreign key constraint relationships, including cascading operations.  Please note that this now is same as the default Postgres matching method. There is a chance that if your schema currently uses composite keys that this may change your foreign key constraints and cascading so please inspect them. [#32693][#32693]
- Mutation statements like UPDATE and INSERT no longer attempt to guarantee mutation or output ordering when an ORDER BY is present. It is now an error to use ORDER BY without LIMIT with the UPDATE statement. [#33087][#33087]

### SQL language changes

- Add support for configuring authentication via a hba.conf cluster setting. [#32892][#32892]
- Added support for collecting table statistics on a default set of columns by calling CREATE STATISTICS with no columns specified. [#32981][#32981]
- Fix problem with schema change getting stuck for 5 minutes when executed immediately after a server restart. [#32988][#32988]
- A new session variable `default_int_size` and cluster setting `sql.defaults.default_int_size` have been added to control how the INT and SERIAL types are interpreted. The default value, 8, causes the INT and SERIAL types to be interpreted as aliases for INT8 and SERIAL8, which have been the historical defaults for CockroachDB.  PostgreSQL clients that expect INT and SERIAL to be 32-bit values, can set `default_int_size` to 4, which will cause INT and SERIAL to be aliases for INT4 and SERIAL4.  Please note that due to issue #32846, `SET default_int_size` does not take effect until the next statement batch is executed. [#32848][#32848]
- New SQL command added. `ALTER ... CONFIGURE ZONE USING field_name = COPY FROM PARENT` now solidifies/explicitly sets the field. [#32861][#32861]
- Add support for matching composite foreign keys using the MATCH FULL method.  Cockroach now supports specifying the matching method for composite keys as either MATCH SIMPLE or MATCH FULL. MATCH SIMPLE remains as the default. A composite key is one that includes more than one column.  MATCH FULL differs from MATCH SIMPLE by not allowing the mixing of NULL and NON-NULL values. Only all NULL values will not be used to validate a foreign key constraint check or cascading action.  MATCH PARTIAL is still not supported.  For more details see: https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/20305 or https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/sql-createtable.html. [#32998][#32998]
- The string_agg aggregate is now supported by the cost-based optimizer. [#33172][#33172]
- Shift operators on integers now always operate on explicit types instead of possibly an untyped constant. They also now return an error if the right-side operand is out of range. [#33221][#33221]
- Support the pg_catalog introspection table pg_am for both versions 9.5 and 9.6 which changed the table significantly. [#33252][#33252]
- Foreign key checks are now added to kv traces. [#33328][#33328]
- CockroachDB now defines columns `domain_catalog`, `domain_schema` and `domain_name` in `information_schema.columns` (using NULL values, since domain types are not yet supported) for compatibility with PostgreSQL clients that require them. [#33267][#33267]
- Attempts to use some PostgreSQL built-in functions that are not yet supported in CockroachDB will now cause a clearer error message, and also become reported in telemetry if telemetry is enabled so as to gauge demand. [#33390][#33390]
- CockroachDB will now report the name (not the value) of unsupported client parameters passed when setting up new SQL sessions as telemetry data if telemetry is enabled, to guauge demand for additional support. [#33264][#33264]
- CockroachDB now collects statistics for statements executed "internally" (for system purposes). This is meant to facilitate performance troubleshooting. [#32215][#32215]
- CockroachDB now supports associating comments to SQL databases using PostgreSQL's `COMMENT ON DATABASE` syntax. This also provides proper support for pg's `pg_catalog.pg_description` and built-in function `obj_description()`. [#33057][#33057]
- CockroachDB now supports associating comments to SQL table column using PostgreSQL's `COMMENT ON COLIMN` syntax. This also provides proper support for pg's `pg_catalog.pg_description` and built-in function `col_description()`. [#33355][#33355]
- Sample logical plans and store into statement statistics. [#33020][#33020]
- Fixed problem with returning dropped unique columns in DELETE RETURNING statement. [#33438][#33438]
- `SHOW EXPERIMENTAL_RANGES` is faster if no columns are requested from it, like in `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [SHOW EXPERIMENTAL_RANGES...]`. [#33463][#33463]
- The new experimental_optimizer_updates feature flag controls whether updates and upserts are planned by the cost-based optimizer rather than the heuristic planner. [#33339][#33339]
- When the `experimental_optimizer_updates` feature flag is set, check constraints are not checked for rows skipped by the INSERT..DO NOTHING clause. [#33339][#33339]

### Admin UI changes

- Surface sample logical plans for each unique fingerprint. [#33483][#33483]

### Bug fixes

- Fixes issue where ranges with high replication factors would be incorrectly down-replicated if enough nodes stop running that the number of desired replicas is greater than the number of running nodes. This issue could cause under-replication and potentially unavailability. [#32949][#32949]
- Fix an infinite loop in a low-level scanning routine that could be hit in unusual circumstances. [#33063][#33063]
- CockroachDB will no longer report erroneous under-replicated ranges corresponding to replicas that were waiting to be deleted. [#32845][#32845]
- Fixed a possible goroutine leak when canceling queries. [#33130][#33130]
- `CHANGEFEED`s and incremental `BACKUP`s no longer indefinitely hang under an infrequent condition. [#32909][#32909]
- `cockroach node status --ranges` previously listed the count of under-replicated ranges in the `ranges_unavailable` column and the number of unavailable ranges in the `ranges_underreplicated` column. This fixes that mix-up. [#32950][#32950]
- Fixed a panic in the cost-based optimizer during the planning of some queries. [#33183][#33183]
- Cancel requests (via the pgwire protocol) will now close quickly with an EOF instead of hang (but still don't cancel the request). [#33202][#33202]
- CockroachDB does not crash upon running SHOW SESSIONS, SHOW QUERIES and inspections of some `crdb_internal` tables when certain SQL sessions are issuing internal SQL queries. [#33138][#33138]
- Updated Zipkin library to avoid deadlock when stopping Zipkin tracing. [#33287][#33287]
- Fixed an issue in which if a nullable column wasn't supplied in an INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE statement, it may cause a panic. [#33245][#33245]
- Fixed pgwire binary decoding of decimal NaN and NULL in arrays. [#33295][#33295]
- The UPSERT and INSERT ON CONFLICT statements were not properly checking that the user had SELECT privilege on the target table, even though they need to read from the table to determine whether there are duplicates. They do now. [#33358][#33358]
- CockroachDB will error with a fatal exit when data or logging partitions become unresponsive. Previously, the process would remain running, though in an unresponsive state. [#32978][#32978]
- The contextual help displayed for EXPORT upon `\h EXPORT` in `cockroach sql` has been updated to reflect the actual syntax of the statement. [#33460][#33460]
- INSERT ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING will now longer ignore rows that appear to be duplicate in the INSERT operands but are not yet present in the table. These are now properly inserted. [#33320][#33320]
- Prevent a crash with certain queries that use the statement source (square bracket) syntax. [#33537][#33537]

### Performance improvements

- Cross-range disjunctive scans where the result size can be deduced are now automatically parallelized. [#31616][#31616]
- Limit concurrency of BACKUP on nodes with fewer cores to reduce performance impact. [#33277][#33277]
- Index joins, lookup joins, foreign key checks, cascade scans, zig zag joins, and upserts no longer needlessly scan over child interleaved tables when searching for keys. [#33350][#33350]

### Miscellaneous

#### Ui change

- SQL queries issued internally by CockroachDB are now visible in the statement page. They can be filtered using the application name. [#32215][#32215]
